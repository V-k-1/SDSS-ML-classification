# SDSS ML classification

I analysed the catalogue data of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data release-14, 15 & 16 to understand the differences in the spectra of three classes of celestial objects- stars, galaxies, and quasars.

3 ML models are trained - kNNs, Naive Bias & Random forests to classify the objects into stars/galaxy/quasar using the available spectra and redshifts.

I visualise the decision surfaces of each model to better understand their complexities.

By performing a Bayesian analysis of feature, I explain why Naive Bias achieves the highest accuracy.
